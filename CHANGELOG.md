## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`b8485e5`](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/commit/b8485e513ce5d310b937a5f504ea9ca5938e37c0) Thanks [@harisjavaid85](https://github.com/harisjavaid85)! - Let the model invoke `/implement`.

  It was reachable only by a human, which left it unreachable from any orchestrating skill: a user-invoked skill can never reach another user-invoked one, so a loop dispatching `/implement` per ticket had no way to call its one implementing step. Opening it unblocks that dispatch. The cost, taken knowingly: any model session may now reach for it on its own once a work item is settled and named.

- [`cb47e49`](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/commit/cb47e49e231d2db7ee0812126dd8970663676795) Thanks [@harisjavaid85](https://github.com/harisjavaid85)! - Route learned facts by arrival site, with the code as the source of truth.

  `domain.md`'s routing is now two steps. The first sorts by kind: a term to the glossary, a decision to an ADR, a rule to operational policy, and a fact about how the system behaves to the second step. The second finds the fact's **arrival site**, the single declaration every reader who needs it passes through, and settles placement and worth together. On that declaration the fact is a comment, held to the bar in `coding-standards.md`. With no such declaration it goes to `KNOWLEDGE.md`, held to a higher bar: only a fact learned by running the system, or by following a behaviour through code that never states it, is worth the copy.

  This replaces the module-boundary test. "Module" is scale-agnostic in this repo's own vocabulary, covering a function, class, package, or tier-spanning slice, so the boundary it named moved with the reader, and `domain.md` ships into repos where nothing defines it at all. The arrival site is self-defining and names the failure it prevents: a fact commented where no reader passes is accurate and unread. It also fixes a case the old test got wrong, where a behaviour spanning several parts is gated by one facade and belongs on that facade rather than in a file.

  A written fact is a **cache** of the code, so when the two disagree the code is what is true, and the change that invalidated the fact updates it in the same pass, because nothing else revisits them. This retires "Facts are pruned when they stop being true", an outcome with no actor or moment, along with the "keep the bar high" maxim and the ban on creating a `KNOWLEDGE.md` for a single-module context, which existed only to patch the old test.

  `code-review` now identifies standards sources by following the agent guide's pointers rather than guessing at `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, so it reaches whatever file the repo documents standards in, including the comment budget in `docs/agents/coding-standards.md`.

- [`b8485e5`](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/commit/b8485e513ce5d310b937a5f504ea9ca5938e37c0) Thanks [@harisjavaid85](https://github.com/harisjavaid85)! - Enrich `/open-pr <slug>` from a local ticket queue, not just GitHub.

  Slug enrichment now probes the **slug** rather than the repo's tracker configuration: a `kind:spec` issue carrying `spec:<slug>`, or a `.scratch/<slug>/spec.md` committed on the branch, with GitHub winning when both answer. The tracker is a property of the spec, so a repo wired to GitHub can still carry a local queue for one feature. Local specs and tickets are linked by commit permalink, since those files exist only on the branch until the PR merges.

  The body's Format rule now keys on whether a reader can resolve a reference rather than on where the artifact lives. The PR body is also written to the OS temp directory instead of an unlocated "scratchpad file", which had been landing inside the repo and leaving the working tree dirty.

- [`d715f83`](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/commit/d715f83d301b15181a3ae149275b02601af35523) Thanks [@harisjavaid85](https://github.com/harisjavaid85)! - Port upstream's improvements into the five skills held at the fork side during the sync.

  The merge kept `tdd`, `code-review`, `to-spec`, `to-tickets` and `ask-author` on the fork's behaviour, which also froze out everything upstream had improved around it. Each now carries both.

  - `ask-author` gains upstream's **Phase boundaries** section, replacing the two-bullet `Crossing sessions`. It carries all five options in order (continue, `/clear`, `/handoff`, subagent, `/compact`) and discloses the reasoning to `PHASE-BOUNDARIES.md`, a file the sync brought in that nothing linked to. The router also picks up `/grilling`, `/resolving-merge-conflicts`, `/to-questionnaire`, `/wizard`, `/wait-what` and `/writing-for-agents`, and keeps the fork-only entries alongside them.
  - `tdd` gains the pointer to `codebase-design` for when the shape of the interface, not the test, is the open question.
  - `code-review` and `to-spec` quote their `description` front matter. An unquoted colon-space makes the block invalid YAML, and `skills.sh` skips such a skill during discovery rather than reporting it.
  - Prose across all five moves to the repo's no-em-dash rule.

  `setup-repo-skills` was missing from the top-level `README.md` skill list, and is now listed.

- [`4c96f7c`](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/commit/4c96f7cc1c7ebc71408e1658c168b20219fa7a16) Thanks [@harisjavaid85](https://github.com/harisjavaid85)! - **Breaking:** remove `writing-great-skills`. Use `writing-for-agents` instead.

  Upstream renamed and restructured the skill in v1.1, and this fork kept the old copy alive for one reason: `write-a-skill` linked `writing-great-skills/GLOSSARY.md` directly, and `writing-for-agents` ships no glossary. It does not need one. Every term `write-a-skill` borrows (**steps**, **reference**, **progressive disclosure**, **completion criterion**, **leading word**, the **no-op** test, **negation**) is defined inline in `writing-for-agents/SKILL.md`, so `write-a-skill` now points there, and at `SKILL-MECHANICS.md` for what changes because the document is a skill.

  `CONTEXT.md`, `ask-author` and the `write-a-skill` docs page follow the pointer to its new home.

- [`3201486`](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/commit/3201486fb50df6391b65690a8ff73de7f43f76cb) Thanks [@harisjavaid85](https://github.com/harisjavaid85)! - Add `/summarize`: one article, paper, or document in, a structured **overview** out.

  The overview is six fixed sections, ending in jump-back references (headings, page numbers, figures, phrases) so any line can be traced to the passage that produced it. Caveats print even when a source hedges nothing, since that is itself information about the source, and anything from outside the source is quarantined under Additional Context. The source is read inline and stays in context, so follow-up questions are answered from it rather than from the summary.

  Scope is already-authored prose (URL, PDF, local document, pasted text), one source per overview. Video, audio, and codebases are out, and synthesis across several sources stays with `/research`. Printed in the conversation by default; saved to `.overviews/<topic-slug>.md` on request, with `source`, `title`, `authors`, and `accessed` frontmatter.

  `setup-repo-skills` now documents and gitignores `.overviews/` alongside `.plans/` and `.handoffs/`, and `CONTEXT.md` defines **Overview** as the artifact, resolving it against "summary" and `loop-me`'s **brief**.

### Patch Changes

- [`545789a`](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/commit/545789a2770377fcac18c6d3ac6a752997698083) Thanks [@harisjavaid85](https://github.com/harisjavaid85)! - Close two gaps where binding guidance existed but the agent never reached it.

  `domain.md` routed the glossary and ADR formats through `/grill-with-context`, which is user-invoked (`disable-model-invocation: true`, `allow_implicit_invocation: false`). An agent writing an ADR mid-implementation cannot invoke it, so the format was unreachable and the model's own heavy Status/Context/Decision/Consequences prior filled the gap. Both bullets now name the `/domain-modeling` skill, which is model-invoked and hands over `CONTEXT-FORMAT.md` and `ADR-FORMAT.md` on relative links that resolve wherever the skill is installed.

  The agent guide's routing table said only `an ADR: docs/adr/`, which reads as complete and stops the agent going further. It now reads `an ADR in docs/adr/, format per docs/agents/domain.md`.

  `implement` step 2 listed the guidance to read as issue access, implementation, review, and verification, leaving out the comment discipline that `coding-standards.md` carries, and its completion criterion asked only that the guidance be _identified_, which a glance at a filename satisfies. It now names code comments explicitly and requires that the guidance be read.

- [`4c96f7c`](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/commit/4c96f7cc1c7ebc71408e1658c168b20219fa7a16) Thanks [@harisjavaid85](https://github.com/harisjavaid85)! - Delete the `skills/personal/` bucket (`edit-article`, `obsidian-vault`), following upstream.

  The bucket was never promoted, so no manifest or docs page changes; the non-promoted bucket lists in `CLAUDE.md` and `.agents/writing-docs.md` drop it. ADR-0002 still names it, as the record of what the repo looked like when that decision was taken.

- [#848](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/848) [`f02e2ed`](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/commit/f02e2ed3624d031272f8547742d23bf6bca8b072) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - domain-modeling: trigger on discussing codebase terminology and on writing or editing a CONTEXT.md or an ADR directly, replacing the narrower "pin down domain terminology or a ubiquitous language" / "record an architectural decision" phrasing. Also drops the "another skill needs to maintain the domain model" caveat, since that's the invoking skill's job to state explicitly, not this description's.

- [#911](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/911) [`4f28947`](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/commit/4f289474bad013fe2be8f8769d733f59d9103d6b) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Quote the `description` front matter in `to-spec`, `code-review`, `setup-matt-pocock-skills`, `writing-fragments`, `writing-shape`, and `wait-what`. An unquoted colon-space left over from the em-dash sweep in [#905](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/issues/905) made each block invalid YAML, so `skills.sh` skipped all six during discovery and they couldn't be listed or installed via `npx skills`.

- [`4c96f7c`](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/commit/4c96f7cc1c7ebc71408e1658c168b20219fa7a16) Thanks [@harisjavaid85](https://github.com/harisjavaid85)! - Drop two fork divergences upstream had already settled: the out-of-scope path and the word PRD.

  `triage` emits its rejected-request knowledge base at `.out-of-scope/` again, upstream's location, across `SKILL.md`, `OUT-OF-SCOPE.md`, `AGENT-BRIEF.md`, `setup-repo-skills/domain.md` and the `triage` docs page. This repo's own records already lived there, so nothing on disk moves; only the path the skill writes into a consumer repo changes.

  `to-spec` no longer glosses a spec as "you may know this document as a PRD", matching upstream. `CONTEXT.md` has told this repo to avoid the term since the spec lifecycle landed, so the remaining fork-authored uses follow: `cross-check-with-codex`'s review instructions, two example descriptions in `write-a-skill`'s `FORMAT.md`, and `to-done`'s full reviewer reference, which also picks up the `SPEC_LABEL` and `kind:spec` names the loop actually passes.

- [`5d42c8a`](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/commit/5d42c8af6e47f8155a1296fc9498e4796e61e1f0) Thanks [@harisjavaid85](https://github.com/harisjavaid85)! - Stop the GitHub tracker profile prescribing `gh api --method POST` for sub-issues and blocking edges.

  `/setup-repo-skills` wrote a profile telling agents to wire dependency and sub-issue links through `gh api --method POST`, which `/setup-claude-code`'s own guardrail hook denies. Two skills in this repo therefore contradicted each other, and any agent following the profile on a machine set up here stalled at the blocking step, every time. `gh issue create --parent`/`--blocked-by` and `gh issue edit --parent`/`--add-blocked-by` do the same work, take the `#number` or the issue URL rather than the internal database id, and clear the hook. Repos whose `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` was written from the old profile need `/setup-repo-skills` re-run to pick this up.

- [#879](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/879) [`d419977`](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/commit/d419977fe07d9e1607d3523f3579310bbb076b93) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - grilling: remove em-dashes from `SKILL.md`, replacing them with colons and semicolons so the instructions read as plain text.

- [`cd5bdc9`](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/commit/cd5bdc929cea8d684a2e46846545836a6b6f3236) Thanks [@harisjavaid85](https://github.com/harisjavaid85)! - Remove em-dashes from fork-authored prose, adopting the rule the upstream sync brought in.

  `CLAUDE.md` has carried "no em-dashes anywhere in this repo's prose" since the sync, while 567 of them remained across 49 files. Each was rewritten to the punctuation the sentence wanted (a colon, comma, semicolon, parentheses, or a conjunction) rather than swapped for a single replacement character. `CHANGELOG.md` is left alone as a historical record of released versions.

  Also fixes a regression from the same sync: `to-tickets` now heads a local ticket file `# <NN>: <Title>` where it used to separate the number and title with a dash, and `to-done`'s loop stripped only the dash form, so every ticket title parsed out of a new queue kept its number. The loop now accepts both, since queues written under the old convention are still on disk.

- [#905](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/905) [`e6e9577`](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/commit/e6e957797d8cceb5b351c0dc840369523f9fb8fb) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Remove every em-dash from the repo's prose (docs, `SKILL.md` files, ADRs, `README.md`, scripts, JSON/YAML metadata), hand-rewriting each sentence with a comma, colon, period, parentheses, or conjunction rather than mechanically substituting the character. `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` now says not to reintroduce them.

- [#878](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/878) [`e3e547b`](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/commit/e3e547b57d549110a0aa6ff40fd7b871c01c76c9) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Standardize cross-skill invocation on an explicit "call the Skill tool" instruction instead of bare `/skill`-style prose, across `code-review`, `diagnosing-bugs`, `grill-with-docs`, `grill-me`, `improve-codebase-architecture`, `tdd`, `to-spec`, `to-tickets`, `triage`, and `wayfinder`.

  - A skill that names another skill in prose ("run the `/grilling` skill") does not reliably cause it to load. This is the documented rough edge behind `grill-with-docs`'s most-reported problem. Naming the tool directly (`Call the Skill tool with "grilling"`) is intended to raise the hit rate. Dropping the leading `/` also makes the instruction harness-neutral rather than less: it no longer assumes Claude Code's trigger syntax.
  - A step needing more than one skill now says so as multiple calls ("Call the Skill tool twice, for `grilling` and `domain-modeling`"), not one call carrying two names.
  - Documents the convention in `.agents/invocation.md` for future skills to follow.

- [`c6b9d70`](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/commit/c6b9d707b0741c78706e3a824f8f46577b82e06f) Thanks [@harisjavaid85](https://github.com/harisjavaid85)! - Tighten comment discipline at both ends: what a comment may cite, and a pass that trims them.

  The emitted `coding-standards.md` said where an over-long comment should go but never what a comment may point at, so the routing rules read one way only: `domain.md`'s `KNOWLEDGE.md` template links out to code, and nothing said whether code links back. Left open, the model's default is to sprinkle `see KNOWLEDGE.md` pointers. A new `## Comments` bullet closes it in the direction the existing rules already imply. A glossary term needs no pointer because the identifier that names it is the pointer. A `KNOWLEDGE.md` entry exists only because no declaration owns its fact, so a pointer to it has no honest home and is a second copy that goes stale on its own; where a specific site would go wrong, the neighbouring bullet already says to leave behind what is true at that line. An ADR is the carve-out, holding rationale among rejected alternatives that provably is not in the code, so citing it is correct where inlining the tradeoff would not be.

  `implement` ran `/code-review`, remediated, and verified, and nothing in that sequence looked at the comments the implementation and the remediation had just written. By then the agent's picture of them is a summary rather than the text, so verbose comments survived to handoff. Step 4 now re-reads every comment in the touched files from the files, cuts what step 2's binding guidance would not have earned, then verifies. Its completion criterion names the sweep, so skipping it no longer counts as done.

- [`a6577d2`](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/commit/a6577d21289a59f77a4c4ac7f829255617dafc4f) Thanks [@harisjavaid85](https://github.com/harisjavaid85)! - Stop `/to-tickets` writing a `Blocked by` body section where the tracker links blockers natively.

  On a tracker with native dependencies the link is the canonical, UI-rendered record, and a body copy beside it is a second place for the two to disagree, and a reader trusts whichever they see first. The section is now written only where the platform has no native relationship, which is also the only case in which anything downstream has to parse it. Local file trackers are unchanged.

- [#880](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/880) [`1dab982`](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/commit/1dab98299c3b81f560026c01b7ebf55ed5d91373) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Stop skills from trying to reach user-invoked skills through the Skill tool: fix cross-skill references that violated the "no other skill can call it" invariant in `.agents/invocation.md`, in `to-spec`, `wayfinder`, `to-tickets`, `triage`, `code-review`, and `diagnosing-bugs`.

  - `to-spec`, `wayfinder`, `to-tickets`, `triage`, and `code-review` each carried a precondition ("...run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills` if not") that PR [#878](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/issues/878) rewrote into a literal `Call the Skill tool with "setup-matt-pocock-skills"` instruction. `setup-matt-pocock-skills` is user-invoked, so none of these skills (user-invoked or model-invoked) can call it. Reworded all five as instructions for the agent to tell the human to run it instead.
  - `diagnosing-bugs`'s Phase 6 post-mortem hand off to `improve-codebase-architecture` (also user-invoked) the same way, from an autonomous, often-unattended bug-fixing flow with no human in the loop to catch the failed call. Removed the hand-off outright rather than softening it, since it rarely fired in practice. Phase 6 is now "Cleanup" only; the mechanical checklist is untouched.
  - Added a carve-out paragraph to `.agents/invocation.md`'s "Dependencies between them" section: the `Call the Skill tool with "name"` convention only applies when the named skill is model-invoked. This is the section PR [#878](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/issues/878) introduced without reconciling it against the user-invoked/model-invoked invariant stated eight lines above it; the gap is most of why this bug reached six call sites instead of one.

  Fixes [#453](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/issues/453).

- [#904](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/904) [`594f0f8`](https://github.com/harisjavaid85/ai-agent-skills/commit/594f0f83188921a60d45d63d6cdac509de20df2c) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - wait-what: follow `CONTEXT-MAP.md` to the right `CONTEXT.md` when a repo indexes multiple contexts that way instead of keeping a single root `CONTEXT.md`.

## 1.2.3

### Patch Changes

- [#779](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/779) [`efce423`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/efce423018fc6468a3239621f1c1bcaacc723801) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Make `diagnosing-bugs` redact secrets.

  - Add a **Redact** section to `SKILL.md`. The skill has the agent show commands, outputs and captured artifacts; the section makes redaction the first move on each — write `<REDACTED>`, build loops against env vars so the credential stays in the environment, and quote only the signal-carrying lines of a captured artifact.
  - The Phase 1 completion criterion said "paste the invocation and its output". It now says show it redacted, and Phase 1 asks the user for a **redacted** captured artifact.
  - Note in `scripts/hitl-loop.template.sh` that `capture` prints its value back to the terminal, so it takes observations while signing in stays a `step`.

- [#781](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/781) [`14bfbbd`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/14bfbbd8654a8d2910299e1a004c19c1979687d8) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Drop Claude Code's tool and agent-type names from the subagent-dispatch instructions in `code-review`, `codebase-design`, and `improve-codebase-architecture`, so the step is followable on Codex and other harnesses.

- [#783](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/783) [`c0fd1e9`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/c0fd1e973e040347d424e09934099f1bd6c2dee0) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - wizard: remove the time estimate. The template drops `TOTAL_MINUTES` and the time-remaining display, `stage` takes a name only, and progress is counted in stages.

## 1.2.2

### Patch Changes

- [#766](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/766) [`4aaccb5`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/4aaccb58d40559d7e3c59a029b2290ae5ba538de) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Make `writing-for-agents` model-invokable in Codex again.

  - Drop `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` from `agents/openai.yaml`. Codex filtered the skill out of the model-visible skills list, so its description could not trigger it — only an explicit `$writing-for-agents` mention worked.
  - Update the stale `interface.display_name` and `interface.short_description`, which still named the old `writing-great-skills` skill.
  - Move the skill from the **User-invoked** list to the **Model-invoked** list in `README.md` and `skills/productivity/README.md`.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#551](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/551) [`697d4ce`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/697d4ce9742da558fd1ba6697c8e9775e2e302dd) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Add Codex metadata alongside each skill's Claude Code frontmatter so the set works in both harnesses without generated copies.

  - Add an `agents/openai.yaml` beside every `SKILL.md` with Codex UI metadata (`interface.display_name`, `interface.short_description`).
  - Mark every user-invoked skill with `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false`, the Codex analog of `disable-model-invocation: true`, so Codex excludes it from implicit invocation while explicit `$skill` invocation still works.
  - Document the dual-harness invocation model in `.agents/invocation.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and the promoted-bucket READMEs.
  - Add `AGENTS.md` as a symlink to `CLAUDE.md` so Codex reads the same repo instructions.

- [#593](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/593) [`0f2bdbd`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/0f2bdbdb06220d2df3718b8f0483157c6c8a8600) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Graduate **`to-questionnaire`** out of `in-progress/` into the **Productivity** bucket, so it ships in the plugin. It turns a decision you can't answer alone into a Markdown questionnaire for the one person who can — filled in async, or worked through together in a meeting.

  Its defining move is that it grills you about the **send**, not the subject: a normal grilling session interrogates the topic, which is exactly what you can't answer here, so the interview asks only who the questionnaire is going to and what you need back, then aims every question at the gap between the two.

  Now wired as a promoted skill — plugin entry, top-level + Productivity READMEs under **User-invoked**, a docs page at `docs/productivity/to-questionnaire.md`, and a Standalone route in `ask-matt` framing it as the inverse of `/grill-me` (mine someone else, not yourself).

- [#680](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/680) [`b3376f8`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/b3376f8d39848dd08572ec2667da4739a67c8c04) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Graduate **`wizard`** out of `in-progress/` into the **Engineering** bucket, so it ships in the plugin — and make it model-invoked. It generates an interactive bash script that walks a human through a manual procedure — third-party setup, a one-off migration, an A→B state transition — opening each URL, saying what to click, capturing the values, and writing them into `.env` files and GitHub Actions secrets.

  The delightful UX is pre-solved by the bundled `template.sh` (progress with time-remaining, confirmation gates, cross-platform URL opening including WSL, hidden secret entry, idempotent `.env` upserts, `gh secret`/`gh variable` writes with graceful degradation, closing skip summary). Everything above the `STAGES` marker is a fixed library that's never hand-edited — the skill's job is only to scope the procedure and author its **stages**.

  Engineering rather than Productivity: it reads `.env*`, `docker-compose*`, framework config and every `secrets.*`/`vars.*` reference in `.github/workflows/` to scope itself, writes CI secrets, and verifies its output with `bash -n` and `shellcheck`.

  Because it is model-invoked, the agent can reach for it the moment it hits a step only a human can perform, instead of dumping numbered instructions into the chat and hoping you follow them. Typing `/wizard` works exactly as before — model-invocation only ever _adds_ the agent's reach. The description is written as the pointer that decides when it fires: what it produces, four trigger branches (provisioning infrastructure, setting up credentials or CI secrets, walking an unfamiliar third-party dashboard, a one-off migration or cutover), and an explicit non-trigger — don't invoke it for steps the agent can perform itself. Work an agent can do, an agent should do; the wizard is for the clicks, approvals and dashboard trips you would not hand to one. The stage-list confirmation before a line is written now doubles as the proposal when the agent fires it mid-build.

  Now wired as a promoted skill — plugin entry, top-level + Engineering READMEs under **Model-invoked**, a docs page at `docs/engineering/wizard.md`, and a Standalone route in `ask-matt` for the steps only a human can take. Model-invocation also puts it out of the reach of [#693](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/issues/693), which drops user-invoked skills from the listing on Claude's desktop and web surfaces.

- [#763](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/763) [`77d207e`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/77d207ef03219cc603e2832e1159cbdd1c91818e) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Reshape the **`prototype`** skill around two ideas: the demo is **a single shareable HTML file**, and the prototype is **a primary source**.

  The logic branch now produces one self-contained file (plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build, no server) instead of a terminal app — a non-developer can open it by double-click and drive it in their own domain language: a labelled state panel, always-available free-play buttons, and a set of tabbed **guided walkthroughs**, each a scenario with the ordered buttons to press underneath it. The portable pure-logic module still lifts into the real code; the HTML shell is the throwaway.

  Throwaway no longer means deleted. Rather than being removed once it has answered its question, the prototype is captured as runnable evidence on a throwaway branch (`prototype/<name>`) out of main, with a context pointer to it left on the implementation issue — so the main branch keeps only the validated decision while the exploration stays findable. The answer (verdict + question) is still captured durably in an issue/ADR/commit.

- [#536](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/536) [`42a5b70`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/42a5b70fcacc7baff1977b13f3919fb2f63af14e) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Ship the skill set as a native **Claude Code plugin**, listed in Claude Code's official marketplace. You can now subscribe to the promoted skills as a managed, read-only bundle instead of copying editable files:

  ```bash
  claude plugins install mattpocock-skills
  ```

  Or, from inside a session:

  ```
  /plugin install mattpocock-skills
  ```

  There is no marketplace to add first — the official marketplace is configured by default.

  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` carries the full plugin metadata (version, description, author, license, keywords) and the explicit list of promoted skills. `skills.sh` remains the universal installer (and the path for Codex and other harnesses today); a native Codex plugin is deferred — see `.agents/adr/0002-ship-as-a-claude-code-plugin.md` for why.

- [#751](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/751) [`355fa74`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/355fa7420b418af838998f7ec4365ceda1c8dfcc) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Add **`wait-what`** — a one-word corrective for model verbosity. Type it the moment a message doesn't land, and the agent re-pitches it: a little context, ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English, and the ubiquitous language from your `CONTEXT.md`. User-invoked, three lines long.

  The mechanism is the name. Concision skills fail by growing — a 400-line skill still leaves the model verbose — so this one is a single precise leading word and nothing else. Names that describe the _output_ (`/tldr`, `/no-fluff`) make the model clip words and lose you further; naming the _listener's_ state asks for both halves at once, fewer words **and** the context you were missing. It also reuses the leading words already in your global `CLAUDE.md`, so the skill, `CLAUDE.md` and every `CONTEXT.md` reach for the same tokens.

  It repairs one message; it doesn't prevent the next one. The cure for jargon is a shared language built upfront with `/grill-with-docs`; this is what you reach for when you don't have one yet.

- [#763](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/763) [`77d207e`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/77d207ef03219cc603e2832e1159cbdd1c91818e) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Name the `/wayfinder` unit a **decision ticket**, and burn research tickets down with subagents.

  People kept reading a wayfinder ticket as an ordinary _implementation_ ticket — a slice of a build to execute — when wayfinder uses them as **decision tickets**: questions whose resolution is a decision. The skill description and its opening line now introduce the term (and say what makes it one), with the `ask-matt` / engineering README blurbs and the docs page matching — while "ticket" stays the everyday word once the term is established. `CONTEXT.md` records **Decision ticket** as a domain term, so the "avoid: ticket" guidance no longer contradicts wayfinder's deliberate use of the word.

  Research tickets are no longer parked for a separately-launched session. Research stays a real ticket type — it's a genuine shared blocker that downstream decisions hang on, and that dependency is exactly what the frontier's blocking edges exist to render. What changes is how it's resolved: because research is AFK, charting doesn't stop and read it. After creating the tickets, the charting session fires a `/research` subagent for each research ticket to burn it down in parallel, capturing the findings on a throwaway `research/<name>` branch with a context pointer. Research tickets are the one exception to _one ticket per session_.

- [#763](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/763) [`77d207e`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/77d207ef03219cc603e2832e1159cbdd1c91818e) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - **Breaking:** rename **`writing-great-skills`** → **`writing-for-agents`**, restructure it, and add a new leading word.

  The reference now covers any document an agent consumes — skills, `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, docs reached by a pointer — not just skills. `GLOSSARY.md` is merged into `SKILL.md` (one authoritative treatment per term; the `_Avoid_` synonym lists and the standalone Predictability definition are gone); the skill-only mechanics (frontmatter, model- vs user-invoked, router skills, the invocation cut of splitting) are disclosed to a new `SKILL-MECHANICS.md`. The skill is now **model-invoked**: it fires when creating or editing skills or modifying `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`. `ask-matt`'s pointer updated. Reinstall under the new name; the old name is gone (no alias).

  The pruning section gains **cache**. Single source of truth now reaches past the document into the environment — `package.json` scripts, config files, directory layout, `--help` output are themselves authoritative, so a doc that restates them is a cache of a lookup, earning its load only when the lookup is expensive. The positive target: cache what the agent cannot find by looking (unwritten conventions, the reason behind a choice, gotchas no config confesses), and leave one-file, one-command lookups to the environment, where they cannot go stale.

- [#533](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/533) [`45afd80`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/45afd8074a8b7de5fe073845d080fa9dd6c429fa) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Add a YAGNI scoping filter to the **`improve-codebase-architecture`** skill's Explore step. Instead of scanning the whole repo evenly, it now scopes to where change is actually landing: if you name a direction it takes it, otherwise it reads the last ~20 commit messages to bias exploration toward actively-developed paths. A deepening opportunity in code nobody touches is a refactor you'll never cash in — the leverage only pays off where you keep editing — so the report stops tidying dormant corners of the repo.

### Patch Changes

- [#763](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/763) [`77d207e`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/77d207ef03219cc603e2832e1159cbdd1c91818e) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Sharpen `/ask-matt` — the router now covers phase boundaries, the two wayfinder mistakes, and two skills it never mentioned.

  **Phase boundaries.** A **phase** is a chunk of work inside a session — the grilling, the implementation, the QA — and the boundary between two of them is where you decide what to do with the context you've built. The two-bullet `Crossing sessions` section is replaced by a decision tree carrying all five options in order (**continue**, `/clear`, `/handoff`, **subagent**, `/compact`), with the reasoning disclosed in a new `PHASE-BOUNDARIES.md`. Three fixes come with it:

  - **`/handoff` was oversold.** It read as the general bridge between context windows. It's narrow: you need it only when something has to _travel_ — a new harness, a new directory, a colleague, or a side task forked mid-phase. What it buys is portability.
  - **`/compact` is the default, not the first reach.** It sits at the bottom of the tree, after the four cheaper or more precise questions above it. Starting there produces a session that's confidently wrong about whatever the summary flattened.
  - **Two branches were missing entirely.** **Continue** is the one to rule out first — it's the only move that keeps the conversation as a primary source rather than a summary of one — and a **subagent** handles anything scoped tightly enough to run AFK.

  Context hygiene's escape hatch now says `/compact` rather than `/handoff` (same harness, same directory, at a boundary — the handoff clause doesn't apply), and the smart zone figure is updated from ~120k to ~150k tokens.

  **Wayfinder routing.** The two mistakes people most often make with the heaviest, most cognitively demanding flow:

  - **Over-reaching for it.** It's slower and denser than a single grill, so it's flagged as the heaviest flow and reserved for the idea that genuinely won't fit one session — a well-scoped feature belongs on `/grill-with-docs`, not here.
  - **Losing the way at the handoff.** When the map clears, wayfinder hands off, it doesn't build: merge onto the main flow at `/to-spec` (which collapses the map's linked decisions into a buildable plan) rather than looping the map straight into `/implement`. Straight-to-`/implement` is only for efforts that turned out genuinely small.

  **Missing routes.** `/grilling` and `/resolving-merge-conflicts` were absent from the router altogether and are now in it, and `grill-me` splits from `grill-with-docs` on whether you are in a working directory.

- [#502](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/502) [`44eed54`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/44eed545186ffd0263e8004867750b80cfddd215) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Make `/setup-matt-pocock-skills` friendlier and align the local-markdown tracker with the current spec.

  - **Triage labels** are now asked about only when the `triage` skill is installed, and then as a single recommended-yes question ("keep the default triage labels?") instead of an override interrogation. When `triage` isn't installed, the section — and `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` — are skipped.
  - **External PRs as a request surface** is no longer a setup question. The GitHub/GitLab templates still carry the flag, defaulted off; a user can flip it in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` later.
  - **Domain docs** default to single-context without asking; multi-context is only offered when the repo shows monorepo signals.
  - **Local-markdown tickets** are now one file per ticket under `.scratch/<feature>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md` — never a single combined `tickets.md`. `/to-tickets` and the local issue-tracker template now agree, and the spec file is `spec.md` (not `PRD.md`) to match `/to-spec`.

  Docs pages for `setup-matt-pocock-skills` and `to-tickets` re-synced.

- [#532](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/532) [`170ad48`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/170ad48655825783d0193e850e31a9aac957bb95) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Reword **`grilling`** for general use. Its description and body no longer scope the interview to a software plan: "this plan" → "this", "enact the plan" → "act on it", and "exploring the codebase" → "exploring the environment". The technique is unchanged; it now reads as a stress-test of any plan, decision, or idea.

- [#593](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/593) [`a4b2009`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/a4b2009a1a3ac9575506c10b4c84f08f9bba7a38) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Rework **`grilling`** from one-question-at-a-time to round-by-round. It now maps the decision tree and asks the whole **frontier** — every question whose prerequisites are already settled — in a single numbered round, then recomputes the frontier from the user's answers and asks the next round. Same 13 questions land in ~3 rounds instead of 13. Facts the environment can answer are dispatched to background sub-agents so research never blocks the round: only questions downstream of a running exploration wait for it. The session ends when the frontier is empty.

  Every question in a round is emitted in one fixed shape — `❓ **Q1** - **<title>**`, then the body (prose or multiple choices), then the recommendation on its own `➡️` line. A round reads as a scannable numbered list with each recommendation visually separated from the question, so you can answer by number instead of quoting questions back.

  `grill-me`, `grill-with-docs` and `triage` run the frontier a round at a time as well — `triage`'s grill step and `grilling`'s Codex `short_description` now say so instead of describing the old rhythm. The opt-out for one-question-at-a-time (a line in your global `CLAUDE.md`) is unchanged.

- [#752](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/752) [`c66bdee`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/c66bdeeee002d81e3f8b21403c07f9a0d7bea6da) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Remove six skills from the repo. None of them was in the Claude Code plugin, but all six were installable through [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/mattpocock/skills), which serves every skill in the repo — so this is what leaves that listing, and where each one went.

  Four retired skills, each already absorbed by a skill that does the job better:

  - **`ubiquitous-language`** → **`/domain-modeling`**, which builds and maintains the whole domain model rather than dumping a glossary from one conversation.
  - **`design-an-interface`** → **`/codebase-design`**. Nothing is lost: the "design it twice" technique — parallel sub-agents generating radically different designs, from Ousterhout — ships inside that skill as `DESIGN-IT-TWICE.md`.
  - **`qa`** → **`/triage`** and **`/to-tickets`**.
  - **`request-refactor-plan`** → **`/to-spec`** and **`/improve-codebase-architecture`**.

  And two that were only ever mine — tied to my own machine and never meant for anyone else. The `personal/` bucket goes with them:

  - **`edit-article`**
  - **`obsidian-vault`**, which hardcoded a path to my own Obsidian vault.

  `skills/deprecated/` stays as a bucket, now empty. `skills/in-progress/` is unchanged and is now described for what it actually is: a beta channel, published on purpose, installable one skill at a time through skills.sh.

- [#734](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/734) [`a2f9333`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/a2f9333669ff53db762c87ecda5a15442060a3be) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Finish the `to-prd` → `to-spec` rename: "spec" is now the only term in the shipped text.

  - **`to-spec`** no longer opens with "you may know this document as a PRD" — the parenthetical is dropped from the skill and its docs page. The local-markdown tracker template drops the same hedge.
  - **`code-review`** talks about the originating issue/spec rather than issue/PRD, in its frontmatter description, its two-axis summary, and the spec-source search order. Both READMEs re-synced.
  - **The GitHub and GitLab tracker templates** now say "Issues and specs for this repo live as GitHub/GitLab issues" — they had been left on "PRDs" when the local template was updated, so the stale term propagated into every repo they were written into.
  - **`docs/engineering/research.md`** pointed at `https://aihero.dev/skills-to-prd`, a dead slug for the renamed skill; it now links `to-spec` like the other nineteen docs pages do.

  The CHANGELOG and existing changesets still name PRDs where they document the rename itself, which is correct.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#406](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/406) [`930a450`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/930a450089f77a49af09001d955db8452a4b867d) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Bring the **`ask-matt`** router up to date with the full skill set. It now maps five skills it was missing: **`tdd`** (woven into the main flow as the red-green engine `implement` drives), **`diagnosing-bugs`** (a new "Something's broken" on-ramp — there was previously no route for a bug), **`domain-modeling`** and **`codebase-design`** (a new "Vocabulary underneath" section), and **`grilling`** (the shared interview primitive). `prototype` is fleshed out as a standalone and the description broadens from "user-invoked skills" to "the skills". A maintenance rule is added to `CLAUDE.md` so any future skill add/rename/remove or flow change triggers an `ask-matt` re-check, beside the existing docs-page re-sync rule.

- [#464](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/464) [`639df6e`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/639df6e7386dfddc739b2aecdeff37a876f2483b) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Promote and harden **`code-review`**. The in-progress **`review`** skill is renamed to **`code-review`** and moved from `in-progress/` into `engineering/`: it now ships in the plugin, is listed in the top-level and Engineering READMEs (Model-invoked), and has a docs page at `docs/engineering/code-review.md`. The `/implement` skill and docs point at `/code-review`.

  It also gains an always-on **Fowler smell baseline** on its Standards axis — a curated ~12 high-signal "Bad Smells in Code" (Mysterious Name, Duplicated Code, Feature Envy, Data Clumps, Primitive Obsession, Repeated Switches, Shotgun Surgery, Divergent Change, Speculative Generality, Message Chains, Middle Man, Refused Bequest) inlined into `SKILL.md` as a fixed baseline alongside whatever the repo documents, not a new third axis. Two binding rules keep it safe: a documented repo standard overrides the baseline, and every smell is reported as a judgement call, never a hard violation.

- [#464](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/464) [`639df6e`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/639df6e7386dfddc739b2aecdeff37a876f2483b) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Sharpen **`grilling`** on two fronts.

  **A confirmation gate.** The agent won't enact the plan until you confirm the shared understanding has been reached — turning the skill's existing "shared understanding" completion criterion into an explicit stop-gate. The `description` also recruits the pretrained **`grill`** leading word ("Grill the user relentlessly") to sharpen invocation, and the docs page is re-synced.

  **Facts vs. decisions.** Grilling now splits _facts_ (look them up — explore the codebase) from _decisions_ (put each one to the human and wait for their answer). The old blanket line — "if a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead" — was written for the live-human case, but once another skill runs grilling inside a resolve-the-ticket frame it read as license to answer _decisions_ autonomously too. Separating the two keeps a grilling agent from racing ahead and answering its own questions.

- [#463](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/463) [`af6d692`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/af6d6922c3e2b5288eef155346cbe319e4ed3bd0) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Add two adjacent Steering failure modes to **`writing-great-skills`**, both about how language you think of as "off" still steers the agent. **Negation** — the _elephant_ — is steering by prohibition: naming what _not_ to do drags the forbidden behaviour into context and makes it _more_ available, not less (_don't think of an elephant_), so the cure is to prompt the **positive**. **Negative Space** — the void — is blindness to the steering done by what you leave _out_: every decision a skill declines is delegated to the agent's priors rather than left neutral, so the cure is to read a draft for its silences and decide each omission deliberately (fill it, or leave it open as a real **branch**). Kept as two entries, not one — they carry different diagnostics and different cures — each a full `GLOSSARY.md` entry plus a `SKILL.md` failure-mode bullet, matching how every other failure mode is carried.

- [`850873c`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/850873cd73d5f81826ebf512ad35d2b1e113001f) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Make the **`prototype`** skill model-invoked, so the agent can reach for it autonomously (and other skills can too). Its description is rewritten around the leading word _prototype_ — throwaway code that answers a design question — with one trigger per branch (state/logic sanity-check, or UI exploration).

- [#409](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/409) [`0d74d01`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/0d74d01cbc64ca27778a49b38599f70c534e76a0) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Add the **`research`** skill — a small, model-invoked skill that spins up a **background agent** to investigate a question against **primary sources** (official docs, source code, specs, first-party APIs), then leaves a single cited Markdown file wherever the repo keeps such notes. It's delegable reading legwork: you keep working while it reads, and get back a document to grill, plan, or design against. Listed in the top-level and Engineering READMEs (Model-invoked), added to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, given a docs page at `docs/engineering/research.md`, and routed as a Standalone in `ask-matt`.

- [#469](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/469) [`a0329ba`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/a0329ba95751f58566ed7ab484475917a68f1629) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Split the **`to-issues`** skill into a lean **Process** and a **Reference** section, and teach it to handle a **wide refactor** — a single mechanical change (like renaming a column) whose **blast radius** fans across the whole codebase, breaking thousands of call sites at once so no vertical slice can land green. The drafting step now points at two co-located reference blocks: the **Vertical slice rules** for ordinary tracer bullets, and **Wide refactors**, which slices the change by **expand–contract** (expand the new form beside the old, migrate call sites in batches sized by blast radius, then contract the old form away) so CI stays green batch to batch — or, when it can't, only at a final integrate-and-verify issue. The issue body template moves into Reference too.

- [#464](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/464) [`386d4ff`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/386d4ff719a7c420ad1454232d0436b01f1b8c17) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Unify the planning skills. **`to-prd` is renamed to `to-spec`** — "spec" is now the single through-line term (it still opens with "you may know this document as a PRD" for discoverability). **`to-plan` and `to-issues` are merged into one `to-tickets` skill, and `to-issues` is deleted.**

  `to-tickets` breaks a plan, spec, or conversation into a set of **tickets** — tracer-bullet vertical slices, each declaring its **blocking edges**. That one artifact reads two ways depending on the tracker `/setup-matt-pocock-skills` configured: a **local file** (`tickets.md`) writes the edges as text and you work it top-to-bottom by hand; a **real tracker** writes them as native blocking links, so any ticket whose blockers are done is on the frontier and several agents can run at once. The edges live in the ticket either way — the medium only decides whether anything acts on them in parallel.

  Publishing prefers the tracker's **native sub-issues** for parent → slice and **native blocking edges** for `Blocked by` where the tracker supports them, keeping the `## Parent` / `## Blocked by` body sections as the fallback. The "What to build" template points at where a `/prototype`'s code lives rather than inlining a snippet from it.

  `ask-matt`'s main flow now routes `idea → /to-spec → /to-tickets → /implement`, and there are human-facing docs pages at `docs/engineering/to-spec.md` and `docs/engineering/to-tickets.md`.

- [#464](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/464) [`0557d57`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/0557d57579d9b3d39839fdaf8d4a6542b17539ce) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Settle wayfinder's place in the docs as a **situational on-ramp**, not the new main entry flow — the grill-led _idea → ship_ chain stays the front door (crowning wayfinder as the default spine is a v2-sized move, not a 1.1). The **`ask-matt`** router now names wayfinder's concrete triggers — a greenfield project or a huge feature build, too big for one session — and the two grill front doors (**`grill-me`**, **`grill-with-docs`**) signpost _up_ to wayfinder for the effort that's too big to hold in one session, so the on-ramp is discoverable from where a reader actually starts.

- [#464](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/464) [`639df6e`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/639df6e7386dfddc739b2aecdeff37a876f2483b) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Graduate and reframe **`wayfinder`** — the skill for planning a huge chunk of work, more than one agent session can hold. It moves out of `in-progress/` into `engineering/` (plugin entry, top-level + Engineering READMEs under **User-invoked**, a docs page at `docs/engineering/wayfinder.md`, and a route in `ask-matt`), landing as a mature skill. The rename and reframe that got it there:

  - **`decision-mapping` is renamed to `wayfinder`**, invoked as `/wayfinder`. "Decision map" was jargony and inaccurate — only one ticket type is actually a decision. The reframe charts a route through a foggy problem instead, giving one coherent leading-word frame — **fog of war**, **frontier**, **the map** — rather than an invented term layered on top.
  - **Destination as the leading word.** Wayfinding finds the _way_ to a destination; it doesn't charge at building it. Naming the destination is the first act of charting — it fixes the scope and shapes every ticket — so the map gains a `## Destination` field every session orients to, and triage pins it before any ticket exists.
  - **Plan, don't do.** The map produces **decisions, not deliverables**; it's done when nothing is left to decide before someone builds the thing. An effort can override this in its Notes.
  - **The map is an index, not a store.** A decision lives in exactly one place — its ticket — so the map only gists and links, never restates; graduating fog into a ticket clears the graduated patch so nothing lingers in two places.
  - **Collaborative by default.** The map moves off a local Markdown file onto the repo's issue tracker: a single `wayfinder:map` issue whose tickets are its child issues — one shared URL the team can watch. Sessions load the map at low resolution and zoom into tickets on demand. Wayfinder stays tracker-agnostic (GitHub, GitLab, local-markdown) behind a pointer in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, and `setup-matt-pocock-skills` seeds the "Wayfinding operations" section.
  - **Claim by assignment, not a label.** A session claims a ticket by assigning it to the driving dev — the assignee _is_ the claim — freeing the label vocabulary to `wayfinder:<type>` alone.
  - **Native blocking.** Blocking prefers the tracker's native dependency relationship, which renders the frontier visually in the tracker's own UI so the human sees what's takeable without opening the map. GitHub and GitLab templates spell out the native recipe, with a body-convention fallback.
  - **Fog vs. out of scope, split.** Two plainly-named map sections — `## Not yet specified` (in-scope fog that graduates as the frontier advances) and `## Out of scope` (work ruled beyond the destination, closed, never graduating) — so beyond-destination work no longer reads as takeable frontier.
  - **A fourth `task` ticket type.** For literal manual work that blocks a decision (provisioning access, moving data, signing up for a service) — the one type that _does_ rather than decides, earning its place by unblocking a decision.
  - **HITL / AFK ticket classification.** Every ticket type is **HITL** (human in the loop — grilling, prototype) or **AFK** (agent alone — research; task is either). A HITL ticket only resolves through the live exchange, so "wait for the human" falls out of the label — a grilling agent that answers its own questions has, by definition, broken HITL. (This fixes students' reports of `/wayfinder` grilling _itself_ instead of the human.)
  - **No-fog early exit restored.** If the opening breadth-first grilling surfaces no fog, the journey is small enough for one session — so it stops and asks how you'd like to proceed rather than building a map nobody needs.

### Patch Changes

- [#464](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/464) [`639df6e`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/639df6e7386dfddc739b2aecdeff37a876f2483b) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Reshape **`tdd`** into a reference-only skill and add a missing anti-pattern.

  **Reference-only.** The red → green → refactor loop is anchored by leading words the model already holds, so the step-by-step Workflow was largely restating the loop. Dropped the Workflow and per-cycle checklist; folded their one durable idea — vertical slices / tracer bullets — into the Anti-patterns section and a short Rules-of-the-loop list. Introduced **seam** as the leading word for where tests go: test only at pre-agreed seams, confirmed with the user before any test is written. Also dropped the refactor stage — TDD is now red → green; refactoring belongs to the review stage, so the refactor rule and `refactoring.md` moved out (its home is `code-review`).

  **Tautological tests.** Added the tautological-test anti-pattern: a test whose assertion is recomputed the way the code computes it passes by construction and gives zero confidence — distinct from the implementation-coupling anti-pattern already covered. Added as a peer at the same sites: a Philosophy principle (expected values must come from an independent source of truth), a checklist gate, and a BAD/GOOD example pair in `tests.md`.

- [`e00eadb`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/e00eadb4bb32c3d5a631ead1a5ed5d6a7c5f74e2) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Extend the **`triage`** skill to triage external pull requests, treating a PR as an issue with attached code that runs through the same roles and state machine. PRs flow inline alongside issues (gated by a per-repo setup toggle), discovery surfaces only external PRs, the bug-only "reproduce" step is generalized into a single "verify the claim" step, and a redundancy check resolves already-implemented requests to `wontfix` without polluting the out-of-scope knowledge base. `setup-matt-pocock-skills` gains the PRs-as-a-request-surface toggle for GitHub/GitLab.

- [#472](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/pull/472) [`d869d45`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/d869d45afc32beab1c2d1350f8de5e81589512cd) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Fix **`wayfinder`** hardcoding the issue-tracker doc path, which broke the indirection the rest of the suite relies on.

  `to-issues`, `to-prd`, and `triage` never name a path — they resolve the tracker through the `### Issue tracker` block that `setup-matt-pocock-skills` writes into `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`, which points at the tracker doc wherever it lives. Wayfinder instead pinned the literal `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, so in a repo that keeps its agent docs elsewhere it silently fell back to the local-markdown tracker — even one whose `CLAUDE.md` clearly declares GitHub issues. It now resolves the doc via that same pointer and reads its "Wayfinding operations" section by name, keeping the indirection consistent across the suite.

### Patch Changes

- [`d20ee26`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/d20ee2684e2a9442698ac3c1e0f2c5b68c4cf296) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Make the **`teach`** skill reuse-first. Lessons are now built from reusable **components** in `./assets/` — stylesheets, quiz widgets, simulators, diagram helpers. Reuse is the default: the agent reads `./assets/` before authoring a lesson, builds from what's there, and extracts anything new and reusable into a component rather than inlining it.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`47bde84`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/47bde84da032afb2e5058f997f3bbca47d321dbd) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Add the **`ask-matt`** skill — a user-invoked router that points you at the right skill or flow for your situation.

  **Breaking:** `ask-matt` routes over the other user-invoked skills in this repo, so it expects them to be installed.

- [`47bde84`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/47bde84da032afb2e5058f997f3bbca47d321dbd) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Add the shared design skills and rewire existing skills onto them.

  - New **`codebase-design`** skill — the deep-module vocabulary (module, interface, depth, seam, adapter) and the principles for putting a lot of behaviour behind a small interface. The language that previously lived in `improve-codebase-architecture/LANGUAGE.md` now lives here, generalized for reuse across skills.
  - New **`domain-modeling`** skill — actively build and sharpen a project's domain model, stress-testing terms against the glossary and keeping `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs current.
  - `improve-codebase-architecture` now draws its architecture vocabulary from `/codebase-design` and its domain model from `/domain-modeling`.
  - `tdd` now leans on `/codebase-design` for interface-design guidance — its inline `deep-modules.md` / `interface-design.md` notes were removed in favour of the shared skill.
  - `grill-with-docs` now builds the domain model inline via `/domain-modeling`.

  **Breaking:** these skills now depend on the new `codebase-design` / `domain-modeling` skills, so you must install them too.

- [`47bde84`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/47bde84da032afb2e5058f997f3bbca47d321dbd) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Remove the **`caveman`** and **`zoom-out`** skills.

  - `caveman` was a duplicate of another skill I was testing and was never meant to be public.
  - `zoom-out` went unused in practice, so it's been removed from the repo.

  **Breaking:** both skills have been removed.

- [`47bde84`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/47bde84da032afb2e5058f997f3bbca47d321dbd) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Rename the **`diagnose`** skill to **`diagnosing-bugs`**.

  **Breaking:** invoke it as `/diagnosing-bugs` — the old `/diagnose` name no longer exists.

- [`47bde84`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/47bde84da032afb2e5058f997f3bbca47d321dbd) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Replace **`write-a-skill`** with **`writing-great-skills`**.

  - Removed `write-a-skill`.
  - Added `writing-great-skills` (plus its `GLOSSARY.md`) — a reference for writing and editing skills well: the vocabulary and principles that make a skill predictable, hunting no-ops down to the sentence level.
  - Exposed `grilling` as a model-invoked skill — the reusable interview loop behind `grill-me` and `grill-with-docs`.

  **Breaking:** `write-a-skill` has been removed; use `writing-great-skills` instead.

### Minor Changes

- [`47bde84`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/47bde84da032afb2e5058f997f3bbca47d321dbd) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Add the **`resolving-merge-conflicts`** skill — a loop for resolving an in-progress git merge or rebase conflict. Standalone, with no dependencies on other skills.

- [`47bde84`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/47bde84da032afb2e5058f997f3bbca47d321dbd) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Rename the skill taxonomy from **Commands / Skills** to **User-invoked / Model-invoked** across the docs, and add `docs/invocation.md` defining the split: user-invoked skills are reachable only when you type them and exist to orchestrate; model-invoked skills can also be reached automatically when the task fits. A user-invoked skill may invoke model-invoked skills, but never another user-invoked one.

### Patch Changes

- [`47bde84`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/commit/47bde84da032afb2e5058f997f3bbca47d321dbd) Thanks [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock)! - Tighten the **`review`** skill: fail-fast ref check, single-sourced rules, and no-op cuts.
